Veilfire writing from a ruin in the Arbor Wilds; the script is so ancient it defies translation.
There are whispers from the Well of Sorrows. It's impossible to understand the entire text, but certain parts suddenly reveal a shadow of their original meaning."She shook the radiance of the stars, divided them into grains of light, then stored them in a shaft of gold. Andruil, blood and force, save us from the time this weapon is thrown. Your people pray to You. Spare us the moment we become Your sacrifice."There is a brief image of an elaborate golden spear, glowing with unbearable heat. Then it fades.The other part of the poem is found in the description of the item, Andruil's Gift:
"She took the gathering storm, trapped its fury in golden limbs, and strung it with the screams of the south wind.Andruil, blood and force, your people pray to you. Grant that your eye may not fall upon us. Spare us the moment we become Your prey."
