The Path of Flame
Remember where Andraste's Champions first set foot in the Exalted Plains, called Dirthavaren by the elves.
Halamshiral's dark heart was conquered, but one last challenge came from the elves, who would not submit to the Maker. They gathered upon the plain; our Champions answered their call. Marching in Andraste's Light, on the Path of Flame: Lord Demetrius Aron, Sister Amity, and Ser Brandis of Lac Celestine, called the Silver Helm.
Demetrius's End
Remember Lord Demetrius Aron, the only one of Andraste's Champions to fall.The forces of the Exalted March met the elves upon the field; our numbers far exceeded theirs. The Champions, kind and fair, gave the elves a chance for peace, but the elves would not lay down their arms. They slew Lord Demetrius in their charge. Maker take him to His side.
Lindiranae's Fall
Remember the victory of the Dales.
The elves were murderous and wild, for the Maker's grace did not touch them. The wildest of them was the she-elf Lindiranae, wielder of the great blade Evanura. Defiant to the last, she met Ser Brandis, the Silver Helm, in single combat, and he bested her. With Lindiranae fell the Dales.
Triumph of the Light
Remember the triumph over the profane.
Sister Amity led the march to the river Tenasir, where stood shrines to the elven gods. These she struck down; standing upon the banks, she sang the Chant of Light. Andraste's Word had come to the Dales, and delivered them from wickedness.<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/3/37/Codex_icon_DAI.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20141218104531"alt="Codex icon DAI"class=""style="vertical-align: middle"data-image-key="Codex_icon_DAI.png"data-image-name="Codex icon DAI.png"width="20"height="20"> Codex entry: The Silver Knight
