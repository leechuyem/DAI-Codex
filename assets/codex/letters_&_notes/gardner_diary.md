"Property of Ira Gardner" is written in spidery handwriting on this collection of homemade recipes and remedies. The last entry reads:
First sign of the plague is coughing and going pale, like blood's run out of your skin. Elfroot soothes the cough, but doesn't cool the next day's fever. That's where the spindleweed helps.
