--Transcribed from a tale told by a templar in Antiva City, 7:13 StormDemons, of course, have no form in our world. When they enter, either where the Veil is particularly thin or through blood magic summoning, they must take possession of a body.
When a pride demon takes control of the corpse of a mage, an arcane horror is born.
