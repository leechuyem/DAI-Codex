I Am The One songI Am The One (Orlais) songI feel sun
Through the ashes in the sky.
Where's the one
Who'll guide us into the night?
What's begun
Is the war that will
Force this divide.
What's to come
Is fire and the end of time.
I am the one
Who can recount
What we've lost.
I am the one
Who will live on.
I have run
Through the fields
Of pain and sighs.
I have fought
To see the other side.
I am the one
Who can recount
What we've lost.
I am the one
Who will live on.
â€”As performed by the bard Maryden HalewellThe elven language version of this song originally appeared in the end credits of Dragon Age: Origins.
