Long ago, when our people were strong and free, we roamed the world and could do as we pleased. But we were taught by Andruil, Mother of Hares, to respect nature and all of the Creator's creatures. Even though the earth was ours, we did not misuse it. They say the great leaders of the People would pray to Andruil for guidance. Where shall we hunt? Where shall we raise our halla? Where shall we settle and build? Andruil would send her messenger, the owl, to show the People the way, and they would follow him to where the land was blessed.Always keep an eye out for the noble owl. You never know: Andruil might have a message for you.â€”As told by Keeper Gisharel to the children of the Ralaferin clan<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/3/37/Codex_icon_DAI.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20141218104531"alt="Codex icon DAI"class=""style="vertical-align: middle"data-image-key="Codex_icon_DAI.png"data-image-name="Codex icon DAI.png"width="20"height="20"> Codex entry: Elven God Andruil
