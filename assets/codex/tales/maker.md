Maker songMaker (Orlais) songMaker
Have you left me hereTemple
Sacred AshesTragic
Mark upon our landSky fall
Let darkness reign on theeNow flee
From the dragon's heartWarring
Battle-scarred eyesBreach
Into the Fade has comeDemon
Please spare my life
And our sonsâ€”As performed by the bard Maryden Halewell
