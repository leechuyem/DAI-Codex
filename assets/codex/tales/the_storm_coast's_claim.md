On the Waking Sea I ply my trade.Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale!
The yarns I spin do please the maids.
So buy the lads a round!Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,But I'll sail until they do.So tell the girls I'm coming home,With coin enough for two.Drowning in the waves, a girl I met.Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale!
I plucked 'er up with a fishing net.So buy the lads a round!Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,But I'll sail until they do.So tell the girls I'm coming home,With coin enough for two.In the Nocen Sea, swims a might beast.Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale!
I'll show you the scar where he sank his teeth.So buy the lads a round!Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,But I'll sail until they do.So tell the girls I'm coming home,With coin enough for two.A cheerful salt, that's what I be.Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale!
A'shore for the night and seeking company.
So buy the lads a round!Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,But I'll sail until they do.So tell the girls I'm coming home,With coin enough for two.
