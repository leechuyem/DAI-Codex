<i> Scribbled notes between Lieutenant Renn and Legionnaire Bernat: </i>

Lieutenant Renn:

Sir. I reviewed our request for supplies. As your second, I am duty-bound to point out the absurd amount of ale listed. Unless we have resorted to drowning the darkspawn.

Respectfully,
Legionnaire Bernat

Bernat,

Don't be ridiculous. There's no such thing as an "absurd amount of ale."

Lieutenant Renn,

You have requested more barrels than we have legionnaires.

Respectfully,
Legionnaire Bernat

Bernat,

Can't even let a dead man have some fun. Fine. Reduce the number of barrels to half. But I expect Tapster's quality, not the piss they sent last time.

Lieutenant Renn,

I will make sure the Crown is aware that the ale is for the esteemed Lieutenant Renn, Vanquisher of Darkspawn, Hero of the Fifth Blight, and... what was the other title? I always forget.

Respectfully,
Legionnaire Bernat

Bernat,

Owner of the boot in your arse, salroka.

Renn
