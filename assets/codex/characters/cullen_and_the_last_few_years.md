Cullen,

Word has spread from Denerim about the summit the Inquisition will attend. The news is half rumors, but with the representatives they say are going, it's clearly serious-and the details are probably not something you can put down in a letter. I will, however, look forward to more glowing descriptions about how much you love Orlesian parties.

Branson's here; his son insists I add "Ello Cul" to this letter. He also insists it be "Ello" and not "Hello". Your nephew is stubborn-how very familiar.

Love,
Mia

Cullen,

Word has spread from Denerim about the summit the Inquisition will attend. The news is half rumors, but with the representatives they say are going, it's clearly serious-and the details are probably not something you can put down in a letter. I will, however, look forward to more glowing descriptions about how much you love Orlesian parties.

I'm sure you and [Inquisitor's name] will find enough danger away from the summit. You always do. Is it worth warning either of you to be careful?

<h3> If Cullen continues taking lyrium... </h3>

I've no word from the contacts you mentioned, but a Skyhold messenger delivered a letter from your sister among the reports we requested. It is not my place, but she sends so many. I do hope you'll read it.

<i> An additional note accompanies the main letter. Both are crumpled: </i>

Cullen,

After how many letters, I don't expect you to answer. I'm not even sure you'll read this. But maybe you will and---I don't think it will help, but I want you to read it all the same. This isn't the first time you've disappeared on me, and I'm no less stubborn. When you're ready to come back, I'll be here for you.

Love always,
Mia
