<h3> If Josephine is not romanced... </h3>

Dear Inquisitor <surname>,

Commander Cullen has reviewed the soldiers. I have written and received so many letters from the Orlesian court, our birds practically blot out the sun. We are as prepared for the Exalted Council as we will ever be. I know this past year has been full of formal meetings--goodness knows I have attended many, myself--but this one will truly test the alliances and friendships we have worked so hard to build.

If I may offer you any advice, Inquisitor, it is this: Keep a ready smile, and remember we have their attention because we are to be reckoned with.

Respectfully yours,
Ambassador Montilyet

<h3> If Josephine is romanced... </h3>

My Dear <playername>,

Commander Cullen has reviewed the soldiers. I have written en received so many letters from the Orlesian court, our birds practically blot out the sun. We are as prepared for the Exalted Council as we will ever be. I know this past year has been full of formal meetings -goodness knows I have attended many, myself- but this one will truly test the alliances and friendships we have worked so hard to build.

Take courage, darling - and please visit me before we begin the Exalted Council. It would make me so happy to see you.

Love,
Josephine
