Anton,

If anyone alive can answer your questions about the social habits of the Greater Vimmark Wyvern, it is Frederic of Serault, Professor of Draconology at the University of Orlais. I have met him a few times, and he is exceedingly knowledgeable about his field of study, although less knowledgeable about his current state of dress, the day of the week, and the location of his quill and ink. But nonetheless, quite brilliant.

Cordially,
Magister Zaldereon Antonidas
