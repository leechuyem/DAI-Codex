Watch out for elves in Halamshiral.

Almost no one notices they're even present. A servant scrubbing floors. A waiter filling glasses. Undergardeners weeding the border. Maids and valets dressing nobles. There's no room, alcove, or alley so private you can't find one there. And they're watching. They're organized.

The rumor you've heard of some mastermind leading the elves is no rumor. I have reports that this "Briala" was Celene's personal spy and assassin, a bard of unusual skill. Who she's working for now we cannot confirm.

Say nothing. They will hear you.
