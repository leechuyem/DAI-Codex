An elaborate group of veilfire glyphs flicker to life. There is an impression of a great battle in the distant past. A spirit protectively watches over Avvar from Stone-Bear Hold as they corner a rival group of Avvar in a forest. They join in battle, and the spirit turns aside blades to protect the Stone-Bear warriors.
There is the snap of arrows, a lash of magic. The rival Avvar fall, but so does the spirit. The sensations fade.<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/1/18/Quest_icon_DAI.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20150406020418"alt="Quest icon DAI"class=""style="vertical-align: middle"data-image-key="Quest_icon_DAI.png"data-image-name="Quest icon DAI.png"width="20"height="20"> It Remains to be Seen
