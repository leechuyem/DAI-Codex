To His/Her Worship, Inquisitor [surname]:
If the Warden became Queen of Ferelden:Part of me wishes that I could help your Inquisition more personally because the danger of Corypheus and the Breach approaches the threat of even another Blight. Regardless, I have my own path to follow, and I must uncover a cure for the Calling if I wish to see my king ever again.I beg you, keep his kingdom safe until I can return to his side.If the Warden stayed with the Grey Wardens:As I have little useful information to offer, please accept the accompanying gifts instead. If, in my quest, I find anything that may be of use to you in your fight against Corypheus, I will send it to you immediately.If Warden romanced Alistair and he stayed with the Grey Wardens:Please take care of him. Like me, he was instrumental in ending the last Blight. I trust his compassion and his strength above any other's, and I would not go though such effort to overcome our Callings only to lose him to your Inquisition.If the Warden romanced Leliana:I was not there for the death of Divine Justinia, but I know it will have hurt her terribly. While her wits and her skill are amazing, Leliana's greatest strength lies in her faith, and to have Justinia die strikes at her very core. I beg you, if she is faltering, help her find her way back into the light.If the Warden romanced Morrigan and left with her at the end of Witch Hunt:Please take care of my family. Morrigan is stronger and wiser than anyone else I have met, and I would not go through such effort to escape my own Calling to lose them to your Inquisition.If the Warden romanced Zevran:If both the Warden and the Inquisitor are Dalish:If both the Warden and the Inquisitor are dwarves:Yours,
Warden-Commander [surname] of Ferelden
