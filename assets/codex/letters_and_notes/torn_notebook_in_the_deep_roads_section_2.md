Many of these pages are filled with sketches of elven statues matching the ones found in the area, along with notes and what look like attempts to practice Qunlat:They say the agents of Fen'Harel caused trouble in the Crossroads. I wish I knew. I wish whoever fights in the name of the old wolf was around to fight when the darkspawn took my clan.Mine is not to question. I have chosen the Qun. The Qun will protect me.Rethost: You all protect
Rethadim: They all protect
Rethsaam: We all protectThese statues are older than anything I saw in my days with the clan. The area's dwarven, though. What were the ancient elves doing down here? Mining? Where were the dwarves? Easier to have them mine it. Not a trading post. You don't go into a friend's home, knock over their gods, and put up your own.War? I don't remember any legends about our people fighting the dwarves. Though I remember my Keeper telling a story about how the dwarves fear the sun because of Elgar'nan's fire. A metaphor for the elves of Arlathan driving the dwarves underground? The Qunari like metaphors. I should share that.<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/3/37/Codex_icon_DAI.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20141218104531"alt="Codex icon DAI"class=""style="vertical-align: middle"data-image-key="Codex_icon_DAI.png"data-image-name="Codex icon DAI.png"width="20"height="20"> Codex entry: Torn Notebook in the Deep Roads, Section 3
